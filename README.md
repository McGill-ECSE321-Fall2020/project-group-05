### Scope
VisArt is a project made for art galleries facilitating Art Piece transactions from local Artists to art enthusiasts. VisArt will provide a website where customers can browse various Art Listings from local Artists as well as some straight from the gallery, if interested, customers can purchase straight from the website. Verified local artists can post their Art Listings which will be stored in our back-end database system.

### Team
#### Nikola Milekic
I am a U2 student studying Computer Engineering. Since the ripe age of 12, I've been writing code whether it be rigging an LED light show on an Arduino or setting up a Java server on Minecraft. I am currently working as a full-stack developer for a start-up and enjoying every bit of it. I love collaborating with new people on new challenging projects and I'm excited to demonstrate my programming skills in this one.
#### Daniel Bucci
I am a U2 Sotware Engineering student with a passion for technology and a proven track record of success in self starter and fast pace working environemnt. I've been writing Android applications since I was 16 years old and feel extremely comfortable with the Java programming language. I am an extrovert that loves working in teams, therefore I am extremely excited to work on a project of this scale in a large team with a suite of professional level tools to work with. 
#### Ryan Au
I am a U2 Software Engineering Major. I've been programming for several years now, including years prior to university, and I bring with me a vast amount of experience with error messages and compile time errors. I'm an indoorsy kind of guy, I play several musical instruments, I like origami, and I'm always looking to take my Software Engineering skills to the next level. I'll do everything I can to make this the best project I've ever made.
#### Yuta Youness Bellali
I am a U2 enrolled in the Software Engineering program. I only began coding last year when I started university so I am still discovering new things and learning everyday. My mother is Japanese and my father is from Morocco. I enjoy outdoor activities and road trips with my friends. Although I am not the strongest in this group, I am motivated to do my best in this project and to be a better programmer!
#### Riad El Mahmoudy
I am a U2 Software Engineering student at McGill University. My experience with coding has been on and off since 2014 but i was able to pick up lots of programming knowledge in the last two years. I'm specifically interested in web-development as I'm currently working as a front-end developer for a start-up. For this reason, I'd like to get the most out of this project and give it my all. Other than programming, I do graphic design and painting as a hobby.
#### Mahin Anwar
I am a U3 Computer Engineering major at McGill university.I've been passionate about programming for a long time. Starting my journey at McGill was a gateway to the vast world of programming. McGill has allowed me to explore different aspects such as Computer Vision, Digital Systems. Besides programming, I enjoy soccer and playing FPS games including Call of Duty:Warzone. With this course I hope to enrich myself and gain valuable knowledge about web development.
