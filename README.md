### Team
#### Nikola Milekic
I am a U2 student studying Computer Engineering. Since the ripe age of 12, I've been writing code whether it be rigging an LED light show on an Arduino or setting up a Java server on Minecraft. I am currently working as a full-stack developer for a start-up and enjoying every bit of it. I love collaborating with new people on new challenging projects and I'm excited to demonstrate my programming skills in this one.
#### Daniel Bucci
I am a U2 Sotware Engineering student with a passion for technology and a proven track record of success in self starter and fast pace working environemnt. I've been writing Android applications since I was 16 years old and feel extremely comfortable with the Java programming language. I am an extrovert that loves working in teams, therefore I am extremely excited to work on a project of this scale in a large team with a suite of professional level tools to work with. 
#### Ryan Au
I am a U2 Software Engineering Major. I've been programming for several years now, including years prior to university, and I bring with me a vast amount of experience with error messages and compile time errors. I'm an indoorsy kind of guy, I play several musical instruments, I like origami, and I'm always looking to take my Software Engineering skills to the next level. I'll do everything I can to make this the best project I've ever made.
#### Yuta Youness Bellali
I am a U2 enrolled in the Software Engineering program. I only began coding last year when I started university so I am still discovering new things and learning everyday. My mother is Japanese and my father is from Morocco. I enjoy outdoor activities and road trips with my friends. Although I am not the strongest in this group, I am motivated to do my best in this project and to be a better programmer!
#### Riad El Mahmoudy
I am a U2 Software Engineering student at McGill University. My experience with coding has been on and off since 2014 but i was able to pick up lots of programming knowledge in the last two years. I'm specifically interested in web-development as I'm currently working as a front-end developer for a start-up. For this reason, I'd like to get the most out of this project and give it my all. Other than programming, I do graphic design and painting as a hobby.
#### Mahin Anwar
I am a U3 Computer Engineering major at McGill university.I've been passionate about programming for a long time. Starting my journey at McGill was a gateway to the vast world of programming. McGill has allowed me to explore different aspects such as Computer Vision, Digital Systems. Besides programming, I enjoy soccer and playing FPS games including Call of Duty:Warzone. With this course I hope to enrich myself and gain valuable knowledge about web development.
