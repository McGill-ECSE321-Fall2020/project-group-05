### Ryan Au
I am a U2 Software Engineering Major. I've been programming for several years now, including years prior to university, and I bring with me a vast amount of experience with error messages and compile time errors. I'm an indoorsy kind of guy, I play several musical instruments, I like origami, and I'm always looking to take my Software Engineering skills to the next level. I'll do everything I can to make this the best project I've ever made.
### Yuta Youness Bellali
I am a U2 enrolled in the Software Engineering program. I only began coding last year when I started university so I am still discovering new things and learning everyday. My mother is Japanese and my father is from Morocco. I enjoy outdoor activities and road trips with my friends. Although I am not the strongest in this group, I am motivated to do my best in this project and to be a better programmer!
